libconfig is a simple library for saving and loading configuration files.

local libconfig = require "libconfig"
config = libconfig.read("My Game's Configuration.celduin")
...
libconfig.write("My Game's Configuration", config)

libconfig.read tries very hard never to throw an error. libconfig.write is less careful. libconfig.read will always return a table, even if it's empty.

Install by placing libconfig.scu where SubCritical can find it:

$ mkdir -p /usr/subcritical/lib/
$ cp libconfig.scu /usr/subcritical/lib/
