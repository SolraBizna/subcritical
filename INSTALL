If you're on Windows, abandon all hope of building it yourself. Setting it up
is so difficult and painful, I wouldn't even know how to do it a second time.

SubCritical's build system is functional, but incomplete. To build and install
SubCritical, first, install Lua 5.1 or later. (see: http://www.lua.org/)

From inside the top-level SubCritical source directory:

$ ./build_all.sh && ./install_packages.sh

You will be prompted with questions about your build environment; answer the
prompts. If you make a mistake, you can delete the .scbuild file from your
HOME directory to reconfigure the build. (Be sure to run clean_all.sh
afterward.)

You can build individual packages, including packages not included in the
SubCritical tree, by running scbuild.lua manually:

$ cd funky-subcritical-package/
$ lua ../subcritical/scbuild.lua all install

The following packages have external dependencies:

  flac (requires libFLAC 1.2.1)
  freetype (requires a fairly recent FreeType 2)
  gif (requires a fairly recent giflib, or a compatible replacement)
  jpeg (requires a fairly recent IJG jpeglib)
  png (requires a fairly recent libpng 1.2 and zlib)
  sdl (requires a fairly recent SDL 1.2)
  vorbis (requires libogg 1.1.3ish and libvorbis 1.2.0 or later)

If you are building on Darwin (Mac OS X) and installed the above dependencies
via DarwinPorts, you may need to set some environment variables like:

  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/lib
  CFLAGS="-isystem /opt/include"

Substitute /opt/local for /opt if necessary.

SubCritical also includes some useful utilities. Currently:
  celnet: simplifies Socket communication via Celduins
  fontman: Font management and consolidation
  garbage: Standardized garbage collection deferral
  libconfig: Configuration file management
  scui: A UI toolkit
See their appropriate README files for more information.
