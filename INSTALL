SubCritical's build system is functional, but incomplete. To build and install
SubCritical, first, install Lua 5.1 or later. (see: http://www.lua.org/)

From inside the top-level SubCritical source directory:

$ ./build_all.sh

You will be prompted with questions about your build environment; answer the
prompts. If you make a mistake, you can delete the .scbuild file from your
HOME directory to reconfigure the build. (Be sure to run clean_all.sh
afterward.)

You can build individual packages, including packages not included in the
SubCritical tree, by running scbuild.lua manually:

$ cd funky-subcritical-package/
$ lua ../subcritical-0b3/scbuild.lua all install

The following packages have external dependencies:

  flac (requires a libFLAC 1.2.1)
  freetype (requires a fairly recent FreeType 2)
  gif (requires a fairly recent giflib, or a compatible replacement)
  jpeg (requires a fairly recent IJG jpeglib)
  png (requires a fairly recent libpng 1.2 and zlib)
  sdl (requires a fairly recent SDL 1.2)
  vorbis (requires fairly recent libogg and libvorbis)

You may also want to install the fontman package and the Liberation fonts, see
fontman/README for instructions on how to do that.
