fontman is a very simple package, simplifying FreetypeFont management:

require "fontman"
myfont = fontman.newfont(P"MyFont.ttf")

Obtain, and automatically cache, different font sizes by indexing myfont. For
instance:

frisket = myfont[12]:RenderText("This is 12-point text!")

Install by placing fontman.scu somewhere SubCritical can find it:

$ mkdir -p /usr/subcritical/lib/
$ cp fontman.scu /usr/subcritical/lib/

If you install this, you may also want to install the included Liberation font package:

$ cp -r liberation /usr/subcritical/lib/

Font packages (like the included Liberation fonts) are encouraged to create
subtables of the provided TTF table (also accessible by ttf):

TTF.MyFamily = fontman.newfont(P"MyFamily-Regular.ttf")
TTF.MyFamily.Bold = fontman.newfont(P"MyFamily-Bold.ttf")

No particular naming convention is recommended.
