scui is a simple (complicated) UI toolkit. It's next to useless without a widget toolkit. You can write your own or use the provided Uranium widget set (or both!).

Widget toolkits are complicated, and documenting this one properly would take me a while. Try reading the examples. (in the examples/ directory)

Install by placing scui.scu (and preferably also the uranium directory) where SubCritical can find it:

$ mkdir -p /usr/subcritical/lib/
$ cp -r scui.scu uranium /usr/subcritical/lib/

scui uses (does not require) garbage, and uranium requires fontman and liberation.

Currently, substantial portions of uranium (including aesthetic enhancements and text input) are missing. This is beta software, whaddaya expect?
