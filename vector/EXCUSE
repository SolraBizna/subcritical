The implementation of this code is a spaghetti mess. Even more so than the rest
of SubCritical. It had very little design ahead of time, and a great deal of
the work is done in the C preprocessor. Not to mention that, during most of the
actual writing, I was having a seizure. In the interests of finishing this
package, I did not go back and update any of the existing code with new design
paradigms; that is why, for example, the generalized splatting code is only
used to implement a few matrix operations.

Don't even think about trying to read this code to learn matrix math. As for
debugging it, $DEITY help you.

Sorry!
