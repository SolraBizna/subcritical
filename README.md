SubCritical contains libraries, bindings, etc. for doing 2D graphics, networking, sound, IO, etc. from Lua. It was intended to be used for writing standalone games, but in practice it was mainly used to write tools.

This engine is not likely to be of interest to modern programmers. It continues to be useful for a few people; for that reason, it is here on GitHub, and will continue to see some basic maintenance.
